    "In this course, you will do most of your work inside a Jupyter notebook running on the course server. The course server that runs the Jupyter system you are using, however, is itself running on a (virtualized) Unix system, essentially in the cloud. In addition, since you will need to read and write data, you will be directly working with the Unix filesystem. Finally, since you will likely work on cloud systems, either explicitly or implicitly, in your future career, it is prudent to learn the basics of Unix in order to be more proficient.\n",

    "## The Unix Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard [Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) system provides a command-line interface to allow a user to interact with the underlying hardware. While this may lack the ease of use most modern graphical operating systems provide, a command line has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible and powerful access to the underlying hardware\n",
    "2. Interactions are identical between local and remote hardware\n",
    "3. Commands can be connected or their input/output redirected\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard command-line interface on a Unix system is provided by a program called a _shell_. While several different shells exist, one of the more popular is the [Bash shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell), which is what we will use by default in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shell allows a user to run (multiple) programs, to redirect the input and output from programs, and to connect programs together by using pipes. They also allow a user to move around the filesystem, and to automate basic processing by writing small programs known as shell scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands are entered at the shell prompt. In this course, we  have one primary shell prompt, the JupyterHub server terminal prompt, which is something similar to\n",
    "`data_scientist@temp_host:~$`. Unix based operating systems, like Linux and Mac OSX, include terminal applications that can be used in much the same manner as the JupyterHub server command prompt.\n",

    "## The Unix Filesystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Unix filesystem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem) provides for data storage and retrieval from the underlying hardware, as well as interprocess communication through pipes. The Unix filesystem is based on a single rooted tree model. The root of the tree is known as the __root__ directory, and is denoted by the `/` character. Sub-directories branch off from this root directory to form the entire filesystem hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files and directories have owners and groups (for example, I am the owner of this lesson, but the entire class will have group access). A special owner is known as root, or the superuser. If you have sufficient privileges, you can switch to the superuser by using the `sudo` command. Each entry in the file system has a permission mask that specifies what the owner, the group, and the entire world (or all) can do to the particular item.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in our Jupyter server terminal we have the following root directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Docker root](images/docker-root.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "listing a number of standard directories, including `bin`, `dev`, `home`, `usr`, `var`, and `lib` subdirectories. Inside each of these directories can be additional directories or files, thus forming the entire tree-like structure. To list these directories, we use the `ls` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ls`\n",
    "This command is used to list the contents of a directory. The directory is supplied as a parameter, for example to list the contents of the root folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ls /\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ls` command takes a number of different parameters, two of the more useful parameters include\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-a` to list all files and directories. Any entry with a `.` or dot as the first character is by default hidden when listing the contents of a directory.\n",
    "- `-l` to list the long format of each entry. This is useful to see the permissions and owner of a directory or file.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![Docker list](images/docker-ls.png)\n",

    "In a long directory listing, the first column specifies the _mode_ and _permission_ in a specific order: _muuugggaaa_\n",
    "\n",
    "_m_ stands for the mode, which can be `d` for a directory or it can be empty, indicated by a `-` character for a file. Other [modes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types) are more advanced (and beyond this lesson), and include a link, a pipe, or a socket; for example, an `l` indicates a link.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next segment contains three _triads_, or permission groupings for user (_u_) specific permission, group (_g_) specific permission, and world or all (_a_) specific permissions. There are three types of permissions available: read, write, and execute, and they are listed in that order. If a permission is not granted, it is indicated by a `-` character in the relevant position. So `-rwxr-xr-x` means the entry is a file that can be read, written, and executed by the user, but only read and executed by the group to which the file belongs or by anyone who can access file. Unix file permissions can be confusing, but with practice will begin to make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The owner, group, and permissions can be changed for an item by using the `chown`, `chgrp`, and `chmod` commands. Each of these commands can take `-R` as a flag to indicate that the operation should be performed recursively if the item is a directory. This will change every sub-directory or file contained within that directory or sub-directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `chown`\n",
    "This command is used to change the owner of a file or directory. May require superuser privileges. For example, to change the owner of _myfile_ to user _rb_:\n",

    "```\n",
