    "## Working with Files\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, or any other system object, we must be careful about properly managing the underlying resource. In this particular case, that means a file and the associated file descriptor that the host operating system uses to reference the actual file. While modern operating systems can typically manage a very large number of file descriptors, when we use virtualization, like with our course Jupyter server, we want to minimize our server footprint. Thus, we need to carefully husband resources like file descriptors to avoid exhausting our server resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a more important aspect is that whenever we open a file, we want to be sure that the file is properly closed and that any data that a program wrote to the file has been written to permanent storage. Thus, we need to ensure that every file that was opened has been properly closed. To open a file, Python has an `open` method that opens the named file and returns a file object that you either read from or write to depending on the mode used to open the file. Conversely, Python also has a `close` method that closes the file object. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explicitly state why a file is being opened, the `open` method accepts a _mode_ argument, whose default values is `rt` or _open for reading text data_. The allowed modes are detailed in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description                       |\n",
    "| ---- | --------------------------------- |\n",
    "| 'r'  | reading (default)                 |\n",
    "| 'w'  | writing, truncate file first      |\n",
    "| 'x'  | create and open file for writing  |\n",
    "| 'a'  | writing, append to file if exists |\n",
    "| 'b'  | binary mode                       |\n",
    "| 't'  | text mode (default)               |\n",
    "| '+'  | open for reading and writing      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, you would only read from a text file or write to a text file by using traditional Python file input and output (with the advent of powerful data science modules in Python; however, we now often read and write data directly from advanced data structures like a Pandas `DataFrame`). Thus, to open a text file named `test.txt` for writing without truncating the existing file contents (i.e., append), you would use `f = open('test.txt', 'a')`, and after all operations on the file are complete, you would use `f.close()` to close the file and release all associated resources. One last item, when opening a file for reading and writing, the `+` mode follows either a `w` to open the file but truncate the file contents, or an `r` to open the file without truncation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, file input/output employs a runtime [context](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=context%20manager#with-statement-context-managers), which is a way to enforce what should happen when a code block is entered and exited. The _context_ is created by using the `with` command in Python, where the rest of the line following the `with` command creates the actual context, which manages the entry into and exit from the enclosed code block. For our purposes, the standard application for a Python context is opening and closing files. As demonstrated in the following code block, we can now open a file, perform operations on the file, and no longer worry about closing the file, which is now taken care of automatically by the context.\n",

    "### Writing Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously described, to write text (or data that can easily be converted to text) data to a file, we need to open the file by using a context (which is created via the `with` statement in Python). We need to define a variable to refer to the newly opened file so that we can write to the correct file. We write text to the file by using the `write` method on the file that we just opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippet demonstrates this technique. First, we define a variable that holds the name of the file that will hold our text data. Next, we open the file as `fout`, after which we write two lines before exiting the context, which closes the file and ensures the text data are correctly written to the file. The second code block uses the Unix `cat` command to display the contents of this new file. We employ one trick in this code block by reusing the new Python variable `out_file`, which we can do by prefixing the variable name by a dollar sign `$`. This shorthand expands the variable to the full file name when the `cat` command is executed, and is a good practice since it can minimize typos and syntax errors (since we only must change the file name once to ensure any changes will be correctly propagated through the rest of our analytics notebook).\n",

In the following Code cell, the file is opened, and a list of airports in the state of Delaware (abbreviation **DE**) is display in a special format. To accomplish this task, we open the file using a context and assign the file to the variable `fin`, which is short for _file input_. Python treats this file input as an iterator, allowing us to access one line of text data at a time (where the end of a line is traditionally marked by the newline character, `\\n`). This line of text is returned as a Python string, which is held in the `line` variable. We split the `line` string on our delimiter, which is a comma, into columns that are held in the `cols` list.\n",

A _module_ can be imported into another Python file, allowing the definitions to be reused. \n",

Thus, to refer to a particular definition, like `arange` one must use the `numpy` prefix, as in `numpy.arange()`. The second form is similar to the first, but the prefix has been shortened to `np`. The third form only imports the single, listed definition, which is also brought into the current namespace and thus does not require any prefix. The last form brings the entire contents of the _numpy_ package into the current file and namespace. As a result, the chances for name collisions increase, and thus the last form is strongly discouraged. Note in this course we generally use only the second form, and the appropriate `import` format will be demonstrated in future lessons for each module.\n",

The Python packages listed previously, as well as other community-standard python packages, are generally safe to adopt as they are well supported and widely available.\n",

We first enclose each string substitution in curly braces `{ }`, and use numbers to indicate the order of substitution; that is, a `0` indicates the first variable, a `1` indicates the second variable, and so on. Next, we provide a colon `:` character to indicate the presence of a formatting code, which consists of numbers and a letter code. The numbers following the colon indicate the field width (in characters) that the column will span and for floating-point data; the numbers after the period specify the precision (or numbers after the decimal point) of the value. The character code indicates the type of data to encode: 's' for string, and 'f' for floating-point.

To pickle data to a file, you  must import the pickle module and open a file in binary writing mode. After this, simply call the `pickle.dump()` method with the data to write and the file stream.\n",
