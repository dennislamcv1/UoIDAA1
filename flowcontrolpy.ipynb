    "The Python programming language provides standard techniques for controlling a programs flow, both in terms of supporting conditional statements, where different code blocks are evaluated depending on the value of a specific statement, to a variety of iterative loop statements that enable repeated evaluation of a  code block until some condition is met. As an example, a loop could iterate until all items in a sequence have been processed.\n",

    "### Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports conditional execution of code blocks by using `if` conditional branching statements. Multiple branches are supported by using one or more `elif` commands, which is shorthand for `else if`, after the initial `if` statement. An `else` statement can be used to handle any results that are not met by previous conditional statements. The code blocks are initiated by a colon character following and indented four spaces, as demonstrated in the following sample code:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the value of the variable `x`, the first, second, or third `print` statement will be executed. `if` control statements can be nested if required by the algorithmic logic, but doing so requires being extremely careful to maintain proper indentation. Nested conditional statements are demonstrated in the following sample code:\n",

    "### Python Iterations and Loop Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports several loop statements, but the most commonly used by far is the `for` loop, which is used to iterate through a sequence like a list, tuple, or dictionary. The indented code block that follows the colon character at the end of the `for` statement is executed for each loop. The following loops demonstrate the use of the `for` loop to iterate through the items in different Python data structures:\n",

    "data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",

    "    x = 10**int(item)\n",
    "    print(\"10**{0} = {1}\".format(item, x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__`tuple`__:\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "for item in data:\n",
    "    x = 10 * int(item)\n",
    "    print(\"10 * {0} = {1}\".format(item, x))\n",

    "for k, v in d.items():\n",
    "    print(\"d[{0}] = {1}\".format(k, v))\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the list and dictionary are such fundamental components of many Python programs, there exists a shorthand notation for quickly building and using these data structures that are known as __comprehensions__. The formalism for either a [_list comprehension_](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) or a _dictionary comprehension_, is to simply place Python code inside the respective characters that are used to create a new list or dictionary, respectively. This code generally involves an iterative process that uses a `for` loop, and can also include an optional conditional statement. For example, the following code creates a list with elements that are the squared value of the integers from zero to nine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this line of code, `data` is equal to the list `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply a conditional statement to this list comprehension to only retain the squares that are even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = [x**2 for x in range(10) if not (x % 2)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this line of code, `data` is equal to the list `[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create more complex list comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = [(x, x**2) for x in range(4)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which produces a list of tuples: `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also easily create dictionary comprehensions by using the curly braces to properly create a new dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = {x: x**2 for x in range(3, 7)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which creates a new dictionary called `data` that contains the following items: `{3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36}`. More complex dictionaries can also be created with dictionary comprehensions, as shown in this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data = {x: (x, x**2, x**3) for x in range(3, 7)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensions are generally faster than traditional list or dictionary operations, and support the application of functions to create the list or dictionary items. Comprehensions can also be nested as required. Python3 also supports `set` comprehensions.\n",
